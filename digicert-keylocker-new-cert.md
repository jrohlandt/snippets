If you already have keylocker installed (see digicert-keylocker.md) and your certificate has expired.
Then purchase a new certificate.
Find "Click to sign.exe" in C:\Program Files\DigiCert\Click-to-sign double click and go through wizard and see if the new certificate shows up.
If not check One Digicert (certifcates) and see the status of cert.If pending: Click the refresh/sync icon next to it.
It should then say "issued" and then it should show up in click to sign.exe wizard.
If signing still fails then restart your terminal!
